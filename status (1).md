Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have coded the basic snake game. We have one section of the snake able to move around the screen by control of the arrow keys.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not created the images for the snake or included the power-ups to make the snake's body longer or be able to pass over itself. We also have to include a background to make the game look more appealing.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We have not encountered any significant problems yet.
