# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Great Snake Game 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of snake where the snake can get a power up where it can hop over itself once without dying.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be a classic game of snake with a twist. While playing, the user can receive a power up where the snake is able to hop over itself. It will be able to pass over itself once without dying after receiving each power up, and can continue to receive them after they are used. The power ups will spawn randomly after every 5-7 objects the snake eats and gets longer when eating other objects. The user begins the game by clicking and controls the direction of the snake with the arrow keys. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or moves into itself (without a power up) and the score goes up each time it eats an object.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will complete a working game of snake with the help of pygame. The game will definitely be a working game of snake.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

What we think we will accomplish is adding the power up feature that allows the snake to hop over itself in addition to the classic snake game. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be to add a well designed start screen to make the game look more professional. We would also like to add more power ups of different kinds (maybe making the board bigger, etc.)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps will be downloading pygame and learning how to use it. We will use to to develop the basic game of snake but we must understand how it works before we can do this. Additionally, we need to learn about sprites about how we will use them for each part of the snake (head, tail, and body) and put them in our game. Sydney will work on researching this because she already has the best understanding while Kira and I will work on downloading pygame and learning how we will use it for our project.
